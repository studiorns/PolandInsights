                    <li>The moderate elasticity suggests that the Poland market is somewhat responsive to media campaigns, but other factors also significantly influence travel decisions.</li>
                    <li>This moderate responsiveness suggests that media investments should be complemented by other marketing approaches, such as addressing specific barriers to visitation like authenticity concerns and perceptions about restrictive laws.</li>
